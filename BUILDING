Noted!

   BUILDING

   Generic instructions:

Noted is written in C++, according to the latest standard, C++11. This means you'll need a relatively recent compiler (GCC 4.7 is tested).

Noted uses the Qt cross-platform toolkit as a GUI and its bundled build tool, 'qmake', to handling building. This makes the build instructions little more than "qmake && make" (though Qt Creator, the IDE is a good choice if you want to do any development). However there are a number of dependencies that must be installed and configured first:

- Qt; tested against 4.8.1. The qmake from this should be in your environment.

- Portaudio; tested against 1.9. Should be in the system's include/library path (generally the way with Linux distributions; noted/Audio/Audio.pro may need tweaking otherwise).

- FFTW; tested against 3.3.0. Should be in the system's include/library path (generally the way with Linux distributions; noted/Common/Common.pro may need tweaking otherwise).

- Boost; tested against 1.48. Should be in the system's include/library path (generally the way with Linux distributions; noted/Common.primay need tweaking otherwise).


   Debian & derivatives (Ubuntu &c.):

You can use the package manager to grab and install all of the dependencies you'll need with:

sudo apt-get install libboost1.48-dev libboost-system1.48-dev portaudio19-dev libqt4-dev libfftw3-dev
