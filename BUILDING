Noted!

   BUILDING

   Generic instructions:

Noted is written in C++, according to the latest standard, C++11. This means you'll need a relatively recent compiler (GCC 4.7 is tested).

Noted uses the Qt cross-platform toolkit as a GUI and its bundled build tool, 'qmake', to handling building. This makes the build instructions little more than "qmake && make" (though Qt Creator, the IDE is a good choice if you want to do any development). However there are a number of dependencies that must be installed and configured first:

- Qt; tested against 4.8.1. The qmake from this should be in your environment.

- Portaudio; tested against 1.9. Should be in the system's include/library path (generally the way with Linux distributions; noted/Audio/Audio.pro may need tweaking otherwise).

- FFTW; tested against 3.3.0. Should be in the system's include/library path (generally the way with Linux distributions; noted/Common/Common.pro may need tweaking otherwise).

- Boost; tested against 1.48. Should be in the system's include/library path (generally the way with Linux distributions; noted/Common.primay need tweaking otherwise).


   Debian & derivatives (Ubuntu &c.):

You can use the package manager to grab and install all of the dependencies you'll need with:

sudo apt-get install libboost1.48-dev libboost-system1.48-dev portaudio19-dev libqt4-dev libfftw3-dev

   Windows (with minGW):

You'll need to download and install all components for a working minGW first. It's found at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-inst/

You'll also need to download and install the Qt Windows libraries and IDE:

http://qt.nokia.com/downloads (making sure to get the minGW versions).

Configure Qt Creator pointing it at the minGW installation and Qt installations you just made.

Next you'll need to download and install boost:

http://www.boost.org/users/download/

Unpack and compile it to somewhere sensible ("C:\boost", perhaps). In any case, remember where the directory is. Compilation is a slightly tedious affair - use the Windows command line (cmd.exe) to execute "bootstrap.bat" in boost's path, then switch to the msys shell to do the actual build, executing "bjam toolset=gcc" in boost's path.

Edit Noted/Common.pri and find the line beginning "BOOST ="; edit it so the path afterwards is the freshly installed boost's directory.

Next, download the latest (stable) Portaudio v19. You can get it from:

http://www.portaudio.com/download.html

Building can be done in msys with:

./configure --with-winapi=directx,wmme,wasapi,wdmks --with-dxdir=/c/DXSDK/Feb2010 && make

Make sure you have the latest DirectX SDK installed, and if the path is different to C:\DXSDK\Feb2010, then change the configure line accordingly. Make sure the path has no spaces in it.

NB. Make sure the msys's "awk" utility is used over minGW's (delete minGW/bin/awk.exe).

Finally, get FFTW 3 from here:

http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html

Having unpacked it somewhere sensible, you'll need to configure Noted with the directory into which you unpacked it. Go into Noted/Common.pri and change the line beginning with "FFTW = " so it ends with the correct path.
