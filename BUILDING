Noted!

##BUILDING

#Generic instructions:

Noted is written in C++, according to the latest standard, C++11. This means you'll need a relatively recent compiler (GCC 4.7 is tested).

Noted uses the Qt cross-platform toolkit as a GUI and its bundled build tool, 'qmake', to handling building. This makes the build instructions little more than "qmake && make" (though Qt Creator, the IDE is a good choice if you want to do any development). However there are a number of dependencies that must be installed and configured first:

- Lightbox. This is a sibling repository to Noted and Noted! is heavily dependent on it.

- Qt; tested against 5.1.0beta1. The qmake from this should be in your environment. This should already be installed in order to have built the Lightbox dependency.

- Portaudio; tested against 1.9.

- libresample; tested against 0.1.3.

- libsndfile; tested against 1.0.25.

#Debian & derivatives (Ubuntu &c.):

You can use the package manager to grab and install all of the dependencies you'll need with:

sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev libsndfile1-dev libresample1-dev

#Windows (with minGW):

First, download the latest (stable) Portaudio v19. You can get it from:

http://www.portaudio.com/download.html

Building can be done in MSys's bash shell (found in the MinGW installation) with:

./configure --with-winapi=directx,wmme,wasapi,wdmks --with-dxdir=/c/DXSDK/Feb2010 && make

Make sure you have the latest DirectX SDK installed, and if the path is different to C:\DXSDK\Feb2010, then change the configure line accordingly. Make sure the path has no spaces in it.

NB. The PATH parentheses issue is still around; make sure your PATH has no parens in it.

If building fails, you might want to ask on the Portaudio mailing list, but as a workaround, remove the offending API from the configure line and reconfigure.

You'll also need to download and compile libresample and libsndfile. libsndfile is avilable from:

http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/

Whereas libresample, almost abandonware, must be downloaded from the Debian repository:

http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/libr/libresample/libresample_0.1.3.orig.tar.gz

Building both should be possible with the MSys bash shell.

Finally, you need to tell the Noted build system where each of the dependencies are by editing Noted/Common.pri and altering the paths (as per the instructions there) to match your directories.

NOTE: In QtCreator, you'll need to specify the MinGW GCC & GDB in the Tools/Options/Build&Run/Toolchains. Since the make command is still broken regarding parens, you'll need to sanitize the PATH variable in the build environment (Projects tab, Build settings, Build environment) freeing it of parens (not a massive problem - just make sure it has the Qt and MinGW bin directories in it and you should be fine).

#Mac OS X

NOTE This section is incomplete.

By far the easiest way to building on Mac is to install MacPorts. Once done you can get all required software with:

sudo port install ...

Since we're using a GNU GCC rather than the Apple variant, it's necessary to create a new mkspec (to avoid qmake putting in an -Xarch parameter). Instructions...

There is unfortunately a conflict between the libiconv used by Apple's libcups and the libiconv used by boost as installed over MacPorts. Workaround...
