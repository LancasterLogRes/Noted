/**
 * All events use the strength, character and temperature unless otherwise noted.
 *
 * Spike represents a singularity in the time-series, generally it represent the onset
 * of an energetic phenomenon, but can also represent the lack of such an eventuality.
 * It is not classified, though the temperature and character field may help distinguish.
 * It uses the position, period and surprise members of StreamEvent; period describes
 * the length of activity that can be attributed to this onset. A value of zero will
 * do something sensible.
 *
 * For non-fuzzily classified spikes, use one of the SpikeA/SpikeB/... events. In this
 * case and temperature represent the prototypical parameters.
 * They use the position and surprise members of StreamEvent.
 *
 * Chain is a Spike-like event subsequent to some other Chain or Spike, such that its
 * contextual meaning is heavily dependent on said preceeding event(s) to the point
 * where the two events may be considered a perceptually gestalt entity.
 * Chains are typically close together and similar in temperature. Echos and drum rolls would
 * be examplar.
 * There's ChainA &c. for classified onsets.
 * They all use the position, surprise and period members of StreamEvents, with
 * similar semantics as for Spike.
 *
 * Jet is for a recurring voice without a clear phase (alignment). It'll probably be a
 * multiple of the beat period, if not the bar period itself. It can represent only one
 * at once and must be ended by EndJet. It uses the period member of StreamEvent.
 *
 * Sustain is for voices that are truly sustained (i.e. not simply
 * decaying slowly). It can represent only one at once and must be ended by EndSustain
 * Multiple Sustain events without EndSustain tweak the temperature
 * of the voice (e.g. sweeping through the frequencies/loudnesses). They should be given
 * in addition to an onset (as in RT we'll have no idea whether the onset will be sustained
 * until it has been going for some time).
 * BackSustain and EndBackSustain are equivalent but allow a secondary background
 * sustained voice to be represented also.
 *
 * Cycle should happen on a 4-bar boundary and determines the upcoming temperature and dynamics
 * through the temperature, strength and surprise properties.
 *
 * PeriodSet, PeriodTweak and PeriodReset give the beat period (i.e. inverse prop. to bpm).
 * They are for informational purposes only. They use only the period member of StreamEvent.
 *
 * Beat and Bar are used to demarkate the start of beats and bars.
 * They are for informational purposes only. They use only the position member of StreamEvent.
